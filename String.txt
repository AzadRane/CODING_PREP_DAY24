There of two ways of creating string
1-> String s = "ssss";   -> It is created on String constant pool
2-> String s = new String("sss"); -> It is created on heap 

String constat pool:
It is managed by JVM
It is a separete block where string objects are held by JVM.


== operator checks the reference of the object 
.equals checks the content of the string 

mutable: the objects which can be changed are called mutable
immutable: the objects which cannot be changed are called immutable


String is immutable.->for sharability purpose.ALSO THE OTHER WRAPPER classes are immutable 


To build string with mutable nature create the string by StringBuffer or StringBuilder class .

Objects of StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable.

Difference between StringBuffer class and StringBuilder class is that StringBuffer class is synchronized by default and StringBuilder is not.
